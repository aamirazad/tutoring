# Unit 3 – Work, Energy, and Power

## 3.1 Translational Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic energy** refers to the energy of an object's motion.

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

---

Claim: "if you double a block's speed, its kinetic energy will double"

 ![[Kinetic energy relates to mass.svg|center]]

$$
K_A = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$
$$
K_B = \frac{1}{2} m(2v)^2
$$
$$
K_B = 4 \cdot K_A
$$

The claim is incorrect. The block will have four times the kinetic energy.

## 3.2 Work

**Work** is **mechanical energy** transferred into or out of a system. Work is the force times the distance.

$$
W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos\theta
$$

$F$ is the force exerted on the system, $d$ is the distance over with the force is exerted, $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the distance.

The area under a Force vs Distance graph is the work.

Work is equal to the change in kinetic energy.

$$
W = \Delta K
$$

## 3.3 Potential Energy

### Elastic Potential Energy

**Elastic potential energy** is potential energy stored in an ideal spring.

$$
U_s = \frac{1}{2} k(\Delta x)^2
$$

$U_s$ is the scalar amount of jules. $k~\mathrm{(N/m)}$ is the spring constant. $\Delta x~\mathrm{(m)}$ is the distance the spring has been stretched or compressed from its equilibrium length.

$$
U_1 = \frac{1}{2}k(0)^2
$$
$$
U_1 = 0
$$
$$
U_2 = \frac{1}{2}(x)^2
$$
$$
U_3 = \frac{1}{2}k(2x)^2
$$
$$
U_3 = 4U_2
$$

### Local Gravitational Potential Energy

Gravitational potential energy ($U_g$) is the potential energy caused by an object's change in position in a gravitational field.

$$
U_g = mg\Delta y
$$

### Total Gravitational Potential Energy

Similar to the [[Unit 2 – Force and Translational Dynamics#2.6 Gravitational Force|Gravitational Force]] equation, the potential energy of objects very far from earth have a different equation.
$$
U_{g} = - \frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r}
$$

## 3.4 Conservation of Energy

The sum of $K$, $U_{g}$, and $U_{s}$ will remain the same in a closed system.

## 3.5 Power

Work is the amount of mechanical energy transferred into or out of a system. Power is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy changes.

$$
P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}
$$

Unit: watt ($W$)

### Example Question

A student collects the following data, determine how much power was used in the first travel to travel up the stairs.

| Trial 1          |                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Mass of person   | $55~\mathrm{kg}$ |
| Time             | $22~\mathrm{s}$  |
| Number of stairs | $14$             |
| Step height      | $17~\mathrm{cm}$ |

$$
P = \frac{mg\Delta y}{22}
$$
$$
P = \frac{55\cdot9.8\cdot14\cdot0.17}{22}
$$
$$
P = 58.31~\mathrm{W}
$$
